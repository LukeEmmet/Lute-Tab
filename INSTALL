tab is a program to typset lute tablature.  It works like TeX  in that
a plain text file (that bears little resemblance to the desired output)
is created and processed into a device independent printer format
file.  This file can be previewed with a dvi previewer and formatted
for your printer with a dvi to printer filter, which is not included
in this package.  This program is not particularly beginner-friendly,
but is quite fast once you have gotten used to it.  

INSTALLATION:
The newest (2.0 +) version of tab does not require TeX or
metafont support - the output is in PostScript, which can be
directly sent to and PostScript printer.  See the instructions for
PostScript output below.

You should have TeX and Metafont installed on
your computer to use tab.  If you don't have Tex installed but
know someone who does, get that person's help.  You *can* install
it without having TeX, but you will have to get the font distribution
(lute8.tar) from sunapee.dartmouth.edu, and get a program to convert
the dvi format output to something that you can print out.  It
is nice to have a program to preview either the dvi files or converted
printer files on a computer screen too.

1: unpack the files - type:

   tar xvf lute_tab3-0h.tar

2: edit the Makefile

   there is a line in Makefile that tells tab where to look for
   the font files.  If you have TeX installed, and you can put
   the font files in the TeX directory this should read something like
   '"/usr/lib/tex/fonts/tfm"' - note the use of two kinds of quotes.
   If the font files are going in your own directory the line should
   read '"./"'  Tab isn't smart enough to look in more than one place,
   so all the font files (actually all the files that end in .tfm)
   will have to be together.  Tab doesn't care about the bitmap
   files with the .300pk extensions.

2a - Edit the tab.h file

   the file "tab.h" includes some lines at the top that
   configure tab for PostScript output.  If you comment out
   the line that starts with 
	  #define DVI
   by placing /* at the beginning of the line:
	  /* #define DVI
   tab will automatically produce PostScript files which
   may be previewed with a PostScript previewer (if you have one)
   or sent directly to a PostScript printer.  If you leave the
   DVI defined then you must specify the -P option to tab
   to print a PostScript file rather than a dvi file.  The 
   PostScript output file is always named "out.ps"

   There is a definition -

#define OLD_PRINTER

   which should be defined if the output file doesn't print
   and reports a PostScript error.   
	
3: build tab - type:

   make depend

   (you do not have to run make depend if you are not modifying the code
   and the compiler doesn't complain about missing headers)

   make

   if make depend does not work for you, find the line that says
# DO NOT DELETE THIS LINE -- mkdep uses it.
# DO NOT PUT ANYTHING AFTER THIS LINE, IT WILL GO AWAY.
   and delete these lines and everything up to the end of the Makefile

4: build the fonts - you do not have to do this if you
   build the PostScript version, as the lute9.300pk font is included,
   and the text fonts are already installed in the printer.
   Besides, the fonts are included in the tar file.
  
   You can also use mf and the file lute8.mf to build the
   fonts yourself - this is necessary if your printer is other
   that 300 dots per inch.  The file makelutefont is a script
   which does that - it builds the fonts and copies them to the
   system font directories.  You may have to edit this script
   quite a lot - to specify other output directories for example.
   You most certainly will have to replace all references to the
   format file <wplain> with <plain>.  You may have to change the
   mode as well.  You had best consult your local TeX maintainer
   if you have one!

5: test it - type
 
   tab music/Lothe.tab

   there should be a message "opening music/Lothe.tab" and a new
   file, <out.dvi> in your directory.  This file (always names out.dvi)
   can be priviewed with a dvi previewer like xdvi, or formatted 
   for printing on a PostScript printer with dvips.  Usually
   you print the PostScript output file by simply sending it
   to the printer - lpr out.ps

6:  if you don't have a way to print -
   Most people have postscript printers - tab really won't work on
   an Imagewriter, inkjet printer, or line printer.  The file 
   out.dvi is in dvi format, which is a format that no printer uses
   but which can be easily converted to the correct format for many 
   printers.  To do this you need to find a copy of something like
   dvips, which takes a dvi format file and writes a PostScript
   format file that you can print.  You will need the font files
   for dvips to work.  You can ftp them from sunapee.dartmouth.edu.
   If you can not find a copy of dvips send me mail (wbc@sunapee.dartmouth.edu)
   and I will help you get a copy.
